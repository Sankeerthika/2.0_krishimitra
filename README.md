   - Enable Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
   - Set up service account credentials
   - Supports OGG, WAV, FLAC formats directly

2. **SpeechRecognition** (free tier fallback):
   - Uses Google's free speech recognition service
   - Automatically converts audio formats using ffmpeg

3. **Audio Format Support**:
   - OGG (WhatsApp's default format)
   - WAV, FLAC, MP3
   - Automatic conversion for unsupported formats

## Debugging & Troubleshooting 🔧

# Using Gunicorn for production
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 run:app

# Using Docker (create Dockerfile)
docker build -t kisanai-whatsapp .
docker run -p 8000:8000 kisanai-whatsapp
