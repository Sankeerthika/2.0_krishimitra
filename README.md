## üèÜ AI Agentic Day Hackathon - Google Cloud

This project was developed for the **AI Agentic Day Hackathon by Google Cloud**, addressing a critical challenge faced by farmers in rural India.

### üéØ The Challenge

**Meet Rohan** - a young farmer in rural Karnataka who represents millions of farmers facing similar challenges:

> Rohan inspects his tomato crop and notices strange yellow spots on the leaves. Is it a fungus? A pest? Wrong fertilizer? The local agricultural office is miles away, and by the time he gets an answer, a significant portion of his crop could be lost. 
> 
> He also faces the challenge of **when to sell** - prices at the local mandi vary wildly day to day. A single day's delay could mean the difference between profit and loss.
> 
> He has a smartphone, but the information he needs‚Äîexpert pest diagnosis, real-time market prices, and guidance on government subsidies‚Äîis scattered, complex, and not available in his native Kannada. 
> 
> **He doesn't need more data; he needs an ally, an expert in his pocket who understands his land and his language.**
